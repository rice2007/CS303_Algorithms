Graph - a hierarchical data structure in which elements related to an arbitrary number of other elements
    many-to-many structure
    nodes connected by edges
    two nodes adjacent (incident) if they share an edge
Graph G = (V, E) where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges
    directed - edges have direction
    undirected graph - edges have no direction
    weighted graph - edges that have an associated value
    path - finite sequences of nodes such that each pair of nodes are connected by an edge
    cycle simple path in which the first and last nodes are connected
    direct acyclic graph - no cycles with directed edges
representation
    adjacency matrix - table wth nodes at columns and rows that gives weighted values at intersections
        represented as an n by n 2d array of boolean vals
            true if there is edge
            must have real vals in weighted graph
    adjacency list - creates an n-element 1d array (or linked list) of connected nodes
        more efficient but with more memory
        uses references to neighbor objects to connect nodes
