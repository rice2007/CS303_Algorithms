BST property - an ordering on the nodes such that
    one data value in the info field of a node is the key
    every key value in the left subtree of a node is less than the key value in the node
    every key value in the right...
    keys are assume to be unique
Insertion
    node insertions must maintain BST property
    insert(S, z) compares the value v (z.key) to be inserted to the value n in the current node
        if (v < n) ? left : right
        continue until v = n or child  == null
Deleting node
    no children, modify parent z with null as child
    one child, elevate child to take z's position by modifying z' parent to replace z by z's child
    two children, find successor y
        if y is right child, replace z by y, leaving right child alone
        else place y with own right child and replace z by y
